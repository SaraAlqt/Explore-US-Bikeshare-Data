# Project Name
Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data
## Description
This project is a part of the Data Fundamentals Nanodegree program. In this project, I analyzed bike share data from three major cities in the United States: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, D.C.
The project involves writing a Python script to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal, allowing users to choose the city and time period they want to analyze.
## Dataset
The data files for all three cities contain the same core six columns:
Start Time
End Time
Trip Duration
Start Station
End Station
User Type (subscriber or customer)
The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
Gender
Birth Year
## Answering Questions
What month occurs most often in the start time?
What day of the week (Monday, Tuesday, etc.) occurs most often in the start time?
What hour of the day occurs most often in the start time?
What is the total trip duration and average trip duration?
What is the most frequently used start station and most frequently used end station?
What is the most common trip (i.e., the combination of start station and end station that occurs the most often)?
What are the counts of each user type?
What are the counts of gender?
What is the earliest birth year (when the oldest person was born), most recent birth year, and most common birth year?
## script
For interactive experience, I wrote a script that took raw input in the terminal to present the statistics.
